# Employee Attrition Analysis Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes employee attrition data to uncover key insights such as:
- Total employee count.
- Attrition rates by department, job role, and salary range.
- Salary distribution and income analysis.
- Business travel impact on attrition.
- Years at the company vs. attrition trends.

The analysis was done using **SQL** for data querying and **Power BI** for visualization.  
The final deliverables include a clean dataset, SQL scripts, and a Power BI dashboard.

## 🗂 Project Structure
- **/data/**
  - `employees_raw.xlsx` – Original dataset.
  - `employees_clean.csv` – Cleaned dataset after data preprocessing.

- **/sql/**
  - `employee_analysis.sql` – Contains all SQL queries for analysis (counts, averages, attrition rates, etc.).

- **/powerbi/**
  - `employee_dashboard.pbix` – Power BI dashboard file showing visualized KPIs and trends.

- **README.md** – Project documentation.

---

## 🔍 Key Insights
- **Overall Attrition Rate:** 16.12%.
- **Top Department with Highest Attrition:** Research and Development.
- **Income Analysis:** Highest annual income = 200,000, Lowest = 10,000, Average = 60,030.
- **Years at Company:** Most employees stay within 0–5 years range.

---

## ⚙️ Tools Used
- **SQL (PostgreSQL / pgAdmin 4)** – For data querying and cleaning.
- **Python (Pandas)** – For additional data preprocessing and CSV creation.
- **Power BI** – For interactive dashboards and visualization.
- **Excel** – For initial data inspection and pivot tables.

---

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Open the `employee_analysis.sql` file in any SQL environment (e.g., pgAdmin).
2. Load the dataset (`employees_clean.csv`) into Power BI.
3. Explore the dashboard in `employee_dashboard.pbix` or publish it online.
