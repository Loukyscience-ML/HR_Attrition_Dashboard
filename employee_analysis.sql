CREATE TABLE employees (
    EmpName VARCHAR(100),
    Age INT,
    Attrition BOOLEAN,
    BusinessTravel VARCHAR(100),
    Department VARCHAR(100),
    DistanceFromHome INT,
    Education INT,
    EducationField VARCHAR(100),

    EmployeeID INT,
    Gender VARCHAR(20),
    JobLevel INT,
    JobRole VARCHAR(100),

);

-- Preview first 10 rows
SELECT * FROM employees LIMIT 10;

-- Rename column MonthlyIncome â†’ AnnualIncome
ALTER TABLE employees RENAME COLUMN MonthlyIncome TO AnnualIncome;



2. General Employee Stats

-- Total employees
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_employees FROM employees;

-- Employees who left
SELECT COUNT(*) AS left_employees FROM employees WHERE Attrition = TRUE;

-- Employees still working
SELECT COUNT(*) AS active_employees FROM employees WHERE Attrition = FALSE;

-- Attrition rate
SELECT ROUND( (COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE Attrition = TRUE)::decimal / COUNT(*)) * 100, 2) AS attrition_percentage  
FROM employees;



3. Salary Insights

-- Average annual income
SELECT ROUND(AVG(AnnualIncome), 2) AS avg_income FROM employees;

-- Highest and lowest annual income
SELECT MAX(AnnualIncome) AS highest_income, MIN(AnnualIncome) AS lowest_income FROM employees;

-- Average & Median annual income
SELECT 
  ROUND(AVG(AnnualIncome), 2) AS avg_income,
  PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY AnnualIncome) AS median_income
FROM employees;

-- Average income by job role
SELECT JobRole, ROUND(AVG(AnnualIncome), 2) AS avg_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY JobRole
ORDER BY avg_salary DESC;

-- Income above company average
SELECT EmpName, AnnualIncome
FROM employees
WHERE AnnualIncome > (SELECT AVG(AnnualIncome) FROM employees)
ORDER BY AnnualIncome DESC;

-- Attrition rate by salary range
SELECT 
  CASE
    WHEN AnnualIncome < 50000 THEN 'Low (<50K)'
    WHEN AnnualIncome BETWEEN 50000 AND 100000 THEN 'Medium (50K-100K)'
    ELSE 'High (>100K)'
  END AS salary_group,
  ROUND( (COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE Attrition = TRUE)::decimal / COUNT(*)) * 100, 2 ) AS attrition_rate
FROM employees
GROUP BY salary_group
ORDER BY attrition_rate DESC;




4. Attrition Analysis

-- Attrition rate by department
SELECT Department,
  ROUND( (COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE Attrition = TRUE)::decimal / COUNT(*)) * 100, 2 ) AS attrition_rate
FROM employees
GROUP BY Department
ORDER BY attrition_rate DESC;

-- Attrition rate by job role
SELECT JobRole,
  ROUND( (COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE Attrition = TRUE)::decimal / COUNT(*)) * 100, 2 ) AS attrition_rate
FROM employees
GROUP BY JobRole
ORDER BY attrition_rate DESC;

-- Attrition by years at company
SELECT YearsAtCompany,
  ROUND( (COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE Attrition = TRUE)::decimal / COUNT(*)) * 100, 2 ) AS attrition_rate
FROM employees
GROUP BY YearsAtCompany
ORDER BY YearsAtCompany;

-- Years at company (Min, Max, Avg)
SELECT MIN(YearsAtCompany) AS min_years,
       MAX(YearsAtCompany) AS max_years,
       ROUND(AVG(YearsAtCompany), 2) AS avg_years
FROM employees;

-- Attrition rate by years range
SELECT 
  CASE
    WHEN YearsAtCompany BETWEEN 0 AND 5 THEN '0-5 years'
    WHEN YearsAtCompany BETWEEN 6 AND 10 THEN '6-10 years'
    WHEN YearsAtCompany BETWEEN 11 AND 20 THEN '11-20 years'
    ELSE '21+ years'
  END AS years_group,
  ROUND( (COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE Attrition = TRUE)::decimal / COUNT(*)) * 100, 2) AS attrition_rate
FROM employees
GROUP BY years_group
ORDER BY years_group;
